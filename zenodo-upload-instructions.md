To have your photo featured, please follow these simple steps:

## Do you have a Zenodo Account?

**If not, create a Zenodo Account:**
Follow these steps: [create an account](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/get-started/create-an-account).

Once you have an account, you can upload your photos.

## After logging into Zenodo:

3 - Before the "*Files*" section, right on top below the Zenodo logo, there is a "*Select a community*" button. Search for **agroforestry-media** and then click on *select*.

- *Hint: if you forgot to do this*, you can submit your record/photo later on by going to your record and then, on the right-hand side, there is a card called "*communities*". Select the ‚öôÔ∏è button, and then "*submit to community*". Then search for **agroforestry-media** and select it.

4 - In the section "*Files*" - Click on "*Upload files*" and a window will pop to search for your agroforestry photo in your local machine.

6.3 - **Add coordinates if you know them**
    
- *Hint: if adding a coordinate to an already existing photo*, just go to your DOI link (you can use the gallery) and then select "Edit" on the right-hand side.
      
6.3.1 - At the bottom, there is a section called *"Domain-Specific fields"*. Click on **Add field**.

6.3.2 - Search for **"decimal"** and both *"Decimal latitude"* and *"Decimal longitude"* will be shown.

6.3.4 - Click on **"Decimal longitude"** and then in the button **Add field and close**.

6.3.5 - Then, back to your record, you will have two new fields to enter the coordinates.

6.3.6 - **How to get your coordinates?**
    
- While we don't use a fancy interface to do this, you can use [Clipick](https://www.isa.ulisboa.pt/proj/clipick/):
    
    - Use the text box above the map to "Search by location".
    - Refine the coordinate by dragging the icon.
    - The coordinates will appear on the right-hand side (after clicking the extract button). Just copy-paste the Lat and Lon into your Zenodo fields (don't forget the negative sign for west coordinates!).
